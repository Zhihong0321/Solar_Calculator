# Section 1: Policy, Legal & Government Programs (2026 Update)

### 🔋 Is NEM (Net Energy Metering) still available, or has it been replaced?

**NEM 3.0 officially ended in mid-2025** and has been replaced by **Solar ATAP (Solar Accelerated Transition Action Programme)** starting January 1, 2026.

If you applied for NEM 3.0 before the deadline and have already received your NEM Agreement Letter from TNB, you're still covered under the old program. New applicants will now fall under Solar ATAP rules.

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** We handle all SEDA and TNB paperwork for you—whether you're transitioning from NEM or applying fresh under ATAP.

---

### ⚖️ What's the difference between NEM 3.0 and Solar ATAP?

| Feature | NEM 3.0 (Ended 2025) | Solar ATAP (2026 onwards) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Offset Ratio** | 1:1 (export = import rate) | Tiered rates (varies by usage) |
| **Export Credit** | Credited at consumption rate | Credited at SMP (System Marginal Price) ~RM0.27/kWh or higher tier rates |
| **Quota** | Limited quota system | Revised allocation system |
| **Applicable to** | Existing NEM applicants | New applicants from Jan 2026 |

**The bottom line:** Under Solar ATAP, you'll still save significantly, but the export value of excess energy is now based on market rates rather than a 1:1 offset. The key is sizing your system correctly to maximize self-consumption.

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Our ATAP Calculator shows you exactly how much you'll save under the new rules—no guesswork.

### 💰 Is the SolaRIS rebate (RM4,000) still available in 2026?

**The SolaRIS rebate program ended in April 2025** and has not been renewed for 2026.

However, there are still ways to reduce your upfront cost:
- **Green financing** from banks (Maybank, CIMB, Public Bank) with rates as low as 0% EPP
- **Tax incentives** for commercial installations (GITA/GITE)
- **Seasonal promotions** from Eternalgy (check with our team)

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Even without SolaRIS, solar pays for itself in 4–6 years. Our financing options mean you can start saving immediately with $0 down payment.

---

### 🏢 Can I install solar on my condominium or high-rise apartment?

**Yes, but with conditions.**

For stratified properties (condos, apartments, serviced residences), you need:
1. **Management Corporation (MC) or Joint Management Body (JMB) approval**
2. **Roof usage rights** or designated solar area allocation
3. **Agreement from the Developer** (for new properties still under DMC)

**Challenges:**
- Limited roof space shared among residents
- Wiring must run through common property
- Some condos have designated "solar zones"

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** We've successfully installed solar on multiple condominiums. Our team can assist with MC presentations and technical proposals to get approval faster.

---

### 📜 Do I need a license to generate my own electricity?

**For residential systems under 72kW: No license required.**

However, you **must register with SEDA Malaysia** (Sustainable Energy Development Authority). Here's what happens:

1. **SEDA Registration** → We handle this for you
2. **TNB Notification** → Required for meter change
3. **NEM/ATAP Application** → For export permission

**Penalty for non-registration:** Fines up to RM 500,000 (don't worry, we ensure this never happens to our customers).

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Our "Turn-Key" service includes complete SEDA and TNB processing. You just sign—we handle the rest.

---

### 🤝 Can I sell excess solar power to my neighbor (P2P trading)?

**Not yet for residential consumers.**

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading has been piloted by TNB and SEDA but is **not yet commercially available** for the general public. Current status:
- ✅ **Tested** in selected commercial/industrial zones
- ⏳ **Pending** full rollout for residential
- 📋 **Expected** to require smart meters and blockchain settlement

For now, all excess energy is exported to the TNB grid under ATAP rates.

---

### 🏠 What happens to my solar system if I sell my house?

**Good news: Solar adds value to your property and is fully transferable.**

**Transfer Process:**
1. **NEM/ATAP Account Transfer** → Submit change of ownership to SEDA/TNB
2. **WiFi Monitoring Transfer** → Hand over app access to new owner
3. **Warranty Transfer** → Most warranties follow the system, not the owner

**Why buyers love solar homes:**
- Immediate electricity savings
- Modern, eco-friendly upgrade
- No waiting for installation

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Keep your original installation documents. Homes with solar typically sell 3–5% faster and at premium prices.

### 📊 How many years until I earn back my investment (ROI)?

**Typical payback period: 4–6 years** for residential systems in Malaysia.

**Example Calculation:**
```
System Cost:         RM 20,000
Monthly Savings:     RM 350
Annual Savings:      RM 4,200
Payback Period:      20,000 ÷ 4,200 = 4.8 years
```

**Factors affecting ROI:**
- ☀️ **Sun exposure** (north-facing roofs are ideal)
- 💡 **Electricity usage pattern** (daytime usage = better savings)
- 📈 **TNB tariff increases** (historically 3–5% yearly)
- 🔋 **Battery usage** (extends payback but adds backup power)

**After payback:** Your electricity is essentially FREE for the remaining 20+ years of the system's life.

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** With TNB tariffs rising 3–5% annually, your savings actually increase every year—making payback even faster.

---

### ❓ Will my TNB bill really become RM0?

**Almost, but not exactly.**

Even if you generate 100% of your electricity, you'll still see a small TNB bill:

| Charge | Amount | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Minimum Monthly Charge** | RM 3.00 – RM 10.00 | TNB connection fee |
| **Export Credit Offset** | Variable | If you export more than you import |
| **SST** | 6% | On any net consumption |

**Realistic expectation:** Your bill will drop by **70–95%**, typically leaving RM 10–50/month for connection fees and minor net usage.

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Some months you may even receive a CREDIT from TNB if your exports exceed imports—but this depends on your usage pattern.

---

### 💳 Are there 0% installment plans or bank loans available?

**Yes! Green financing is widely available:**

| Bank | Program | Rate | Tenure |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| **Maybank** | EPP (Easy Payment Plan) | 0% – 2.5% | 6–60 months |
| **CIMB** | Green Financing | 0% – 3.5% | 6–12 months |
| **Public Bank** | Solar Financing | 2.5% – 3.5% | 6–60 months |
| **Hong Leong** | Green Installment | 3.5% – 6% | 12–60 months |

**How it works:**
1. Pay **5% down payment** (cash/credit card)
2. Finance **95%** via bank EPP
3. Your monthly installment may be LESS than your old TNB bill

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** We have partnerships with multiple banks. Ask us about the current best rates—we'll help you compare and apply.

---

### 🧾 Is there personal income tax relief for installing solar?

**For residential: No direct income tax relief** (unlike commercial installations).

**Available incentives:**
- ✅ **GITA (Green Investment Tax Allowance)** → For commercial/industrial only
- ✅ **GITE (Green Income Tax Exemption)** → For commercial solar income
- ❌ **Personal tax relief** → Not available for residential solar (as of 2026)

**The real tax benefit:** Your solar savings are TAX-FREE. Unlike salary income, the money you save on electricity bills isn't taxable.

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Commercial property owners can claim up to 70% tax allowance on solar investments. Ask about our commercial packages.

---

### 🔌 Do I have to pay for the new TNB meter?

**Usually included or a minimal fee.**

**The process:**
1. TNB replaces your old **uni-directional meter** with a **bi-directional meter** (tracks import AND export)
2. **Cost:** RM 0 – RM 500 (varies by TNB region and meter type)
3. **Who pays:** Often absorbed by installer or charged separately

**Timeline:** 2–4 weeks after SEDA approval

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Our quotes typically include the bi-directional meter cost—no surprises.

---

### 🔍 Are there any hidden costs after installation?

**We believe in transparency. Here are potential future costs:**

| Cost | When | Estimated Amount |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Panel cleaning** | 1–2x per year | RM 150–300/service (optional) |
| **Inverter replacement** | Year 10–15 | RM 3,000–8,000 |
| **Insurance** | Annual | RM 200–500/year (optional) |
| **Monitoring subscription** | After Year 5 | Often free for life with Eternalgy |

**Good news:**
- Panels have **25-year warranties** (performance guaranteed)
- Most inverters have **10-year warranties**
- Rain usually keeps panels clean ( Malaysia's frequent rain helps!)

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Our systems include 5-year workmanship warranty. We also offer affordable extended maintenance packages.

# Section 3: Technical & Suitability

### 🌧️ Does solar work when it's raining or during monsoon season?

**Yes, but at reduced efficiency.**

| Weather Condition | Efficiency | Output |
|-------------------|------------|--------|
| **Bright sun** | 100% | Full power |
| **Cloudy/overcast** | 60–80% | Reduced output |
| **Light rain** | 30–50% | Low output |
| **Heavy rain/storm** | 10–25% | Minimal output |
| **Night** | 0% | No output (draw from grid) |

**The yearly average matters more than daily fluctuations.** Even with Malaysia's monsoon seasons, we get enough annual sunshine to make solar highly viable (4–5 kWh/m²/day average).

**During outages:** Standard systems shut off (anti-islanding). You need a **battery + hybrid inverter** for backup power.

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Our calculations use 3.4–4.0 sun peak hours average—accounting for rainy seasons. You're still protected.

---

### 🏠 Will installation damage my roof or cause leaks?

**Not when done correctly by certified installers.**

**Our protection measures:**
- ✅ **Waterproof mounting** → EPDM rubber seals + marine-grade sealant
- ✅ **Clip-mounting** for tiled roofs → No drilling through tiles
- ✅ **Structural assessment** → We check load-bearing capacity first
- ✅ **Leak warranty** → 5-year workmanship warranty covers waterproofing

**Mounting by roof type:**
| Roof Type | Method | Leak Risk |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Concrete/tile** | Stainless steel hooks + flashing | Very Low |
| **Metal deck** | Clamp mounting (no penetration) | None |
| **Flat concrete** | Ballasted (weighted) mounting | None |

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** We've completed 1,000+ installations with zero leak complaints. Our installers are GAF-certified and follow strict waterproofing protocols.

---

### 🔧 My roof is flat/metal/clay tile. Is it compatible?

**All roof types are compatible with solar.**

| Roof Type | Mounting Method | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Clay/concrete tiles** | Hook + flashing system | Most common in Malaysia |
| **Metal deck** | Direct clamp attachment | No drilling required |
| **Flat concrete** | Ballasted (weighted) racks | Angle tilted 10–15° |
| **Asphalt shingles** | Flashing + lag bolts | Rare in Malaysia |

**Considerations:**
- **Orientation:** North-facing is best; East/West acceptable; South is least ideal
- **Shading:** Trees, water tanks, or neighboring buildings reduce efficiency
- **Age:** Roofs older than 15 years should be inspected first

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** We conduct a free site assessment to determine the optimal mounting solution for your specific roof type.

---

### 🔋 Do I need a battery storage system?

**For most residential users: No, but it depends on your goals.**

**Without Battery (Grid-Tied):**
- ✅ Lower cost (RM 0 for battery)
- ✅ Shorter payback period
- ❌ No power during blackouts
- ❌ Excess energy exported to grid (ATAP rates)

**With Battery (Hybrid System):**
- ✅ Backup power during outages
- ✅ Store excess for night use
- ❌ Higher upfront cost (+RM 8,000–15,000)
- ❌ Longer payback period

**Battery is RECOMMENDED if:**
- You experience frequent TNB outages
- Your area has unstable grid supply
- You want energy independence

**Battery is MANDATORY for:**
- Commercial systems >1MW (SELCO regulations)

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Start with grid-tied. You can always add a battery later—our systems are upgrade-ready.

---

### ⚡ If there's a blackout, will I still have electricity?

**Standard systems: NO.**

**Why?** Safety regulations require "anti-islanding"—your inverter automatically shuts off during outages to protect TNB workers repairing lines.

**For backup power, you need:**
1. **Hybrid inverter** (not standard string inverter)
2. **Battery storage** (minimum 5–10 kWh)
3. **Essential load circuit** (selected outlets only)

**Backup capability:**
| Battery Size | Can Power | Duration |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **5 kWh** | Lights, fans, WiFi, fridge | 4–8 hours |
| **10 kWh** | Above + AC (1 unit), TV | 8–12 hours |
| **15+ kWh** | Whole house | 12–24 hours |

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** Ask about our "Essential Backup" package—a cost-effective battery solution for critical loads only.

### ⏳ How long do solar panels last?

**Performance warranty: 25–30 years**
**Product warranty: 12–15 years**

**What this means:**
- After 25 years, panels guarantee **at least 80–85%** of original output
- Most panels continue working at 70%+ efficiency even after 30 years
- Inverters typically last 10–15 years (shorter lifespan)

**Malaysia advantage:** Our tropical climate (no freezing) actually extends panel life compared to temperate countries.

> 💡 **Eternalgy Tip:** We only install Tier 1 panels (Jinko, LONGi, Canadian Solar) with proven 25-year performance guarantees.

---

### 📉 Do panels degrade over time?

**Yes, but slowly—about 0.5–0.8% per year.**

**Degradation breakdown:**
- **Year 1:** 2–3% (initial light-induced degradation)
- **Years 2–25:** 0.5–0.55% per year
- **After Year 25:** Slower degradation

**Example:**
```
Year 1:   100% output
Year 10:  95% output  
Year 25:  85% output (guaranteed minimum)
Year 30:  80% output (estimated)
```

**Even at 80% after 30 years, your system is still producing significant savings.**

---

# Section 4: Installation & Process
